\section{Stationary bootstrap of copula parameter standard errors} \label{App:Appendix_bootstrap}
We rely on the multi-step maximum likelihood estimation of the copula model, which takes the standardized residuals of marginal distributions as given in the second step. The first estimation step introduces parameter uncertainty that is not taken into account by the conventional standard errors of the second estimation.\footnote{Here, our model deviates from~\textcite{ChristoffersenLanglois2013}, who use a semi-parametric model that uses the empirical density function, and find standard errors using the analytical approach in~\textcite{ChenFan2006}. However, those errors are not valid in a time-varying copula context, as the estimation of means and variances impact the asymptotic distributions of copula parameters~\autocite{Remillard2010}.} We use the stationary block bootstrap method of \textcite{PolitisRomano1994} with a block length of 45 weeks (approx. 1 year of data) to find reliable standard errors for copula parameters. The procedure is theoretically supported by \textcite{GonclavesWhite2004} and implemented as follows:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item Generate a block bootstrap version of the original weekly return data
    \item Estimate the ARMA-GJR-GARCH models and calculate standardized residuals
    \item Transform standardized residuals to uniform and estimate the copula model
    \item Collect the copula parameters $\Theta_i$
    \item Repeat (i)-(iv) N times to get $\{\Theta_i\}^{N}_{i=1}$
    \item Use the standard errors from the empirical distribution of $\{\Theta_i\}^{N}_{i=1}$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Univariate diagnostic tests}
\label{app:univariate_diagnostics}

\textbf{Autocorrelation test}

The autocorrelation test is a weighted Ljung-Box test, following~\textcite{FisherGallagher2012} and~\textcite{LjungBox1978}. Under the null of a correctly specified model with no serial correlation, the weighted Ljung-Box test has been shown to generate results closer to its asymptotic distribution than the standard Ljung-Box test. The test statistic is given by
\begin{align}
  Q_W = T (T+2) \sum\limits^m_{k = 1} \frac{m-k+1}{m} \frac{\hat{r}_{k}^{2} (\hat{\epsilon}_{t} / \hat{\sigma}_{t})}{T-k}
\end{align}
where $T$ is the number of observations, $\hat{r}^{2}_{k} ( \hat{\epsilon}_{t} / \hat{\sigma}_{t} )$ is the squared sample autocorrelation of standardized residuals with lag order $k$ and max lag order $m$. Under the null, the test statistic is asymptotically distributed $\sum\limits^m_{k = 1} \chi^2_k \gamma_k$, where $\{\chi^2_k\}$ are independent chi-squared random variables with one degree of freedom and $\{\gamma_k\}$ are eigenvalues of a weighting matrix. We consider two maximum lag orders, 5 and 10 weeks. The maximum lag length was chosen by visual inspection of the autocorrelation functions for standardized residuals.

\textbf{Volatility clustering test}

For ARCH effects, we use the weighted LM test, following~\textcite{FisherGallagher2012} and~\textcite{LiMak1994}. The test has the null of no autocorrelation in standardized squared residuals from the model, and the test statistic is given by:
\begin{align}
  LM_W = T \sum\limits_{k = b + 1}^{m} \frac{m - k + (b+1)}{m} \hat{r}^{2}_{k} (\hat{\epsilon}^{2}_{t} / \hat{\sigma}_{t})
\end{align}
where $T$ is the number of observations, $b$ the number of autoregressive lags in the GARCH ($b=1$), $\hat{r}^2_k (\hat{\epsilon}^2_t / \hat{\sigma}_t)$ is the squared sample autocorrelation of standardized squared residuals with lag order $k$ and max lag order $m$. Under the null, the test statistic is asymptotically distributed $\sum\limits^m_{k = 1} \chi^2_k w_k$, where $\{\chi^2_k\}$ are independent chi-squared random variables with one degree of freedom and $\{w_k\}$ are the weighting parameters ($w = (m - k + (b+1))/m$). The maximum lag length was chosen by visual inspection of the autocorrelation functions for standardized squared residuals.

\textbf{Leverage effect test}

We use the sign bias test of~\textcite{EngleNg1993} to determine whether there are significant leverage effects in the factor returns. Run the regression
\begin{align}
  \hat{z}_t^2 = c_0 + c_1 I_{\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1} < 0} + c_2 I_{\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1} < 0} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}_{t-1} + c_3 I_{\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1} \geq 0} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}_{t-1} + u_t
\end{align}
where $\hat{z}_t^2$ are the standardized squared residuals of the ARMA-GARCH model, $I_\cdot$ are indicator functions that are equal to one when the subscript conditions are true, and $\hat{\epsilon}_{t-1}$ are the lagged ARMA-GARCH residuals. For the test of negative sign bias (i.e. leverage effect), the null hypothesis is $H_0: c_2 = 0$, and for the test of positive sign bias (i.e. reverse leverage effect), the null hypothesis is $H_0: c_3 = 3$. The Wald test statistics are asymptotically distributed $\chi^2$ with one degree of freedom.
