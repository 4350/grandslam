\section{Putting our copula model to work}
\label{sec:model_work}
% now, lets see what this model can say about a few things



\subsection{Out-of-sample mean-variance investing}
\label{subsec:mean_variance}

Ok, so given fama french regressions, what actually happens to MV weights, do they go to zero? Explain method for out-of-sample distributions, simulation based. Show that weights don't go to zero, not for sample and not for advanced super copula model. What is the out-of-sample investment performance of relying on the best copula model? It looks pretty good but not drastically better than relying on sample average -- OOS is hard.

\subsection{Conditional diversification benefits}
\label{subsec:cdb}

What are the theoretical diversificaiton benefits of including HML? Is HML or CMA riskier if one can only choose either or? What is the impact of RMW?
