\section{Multivariate dependence in univariate residuals} % (fold)
%\label
% explain the logic in what we are doing, that there might still be dependence in what looks like white noise residuals

\subsection{Threshold correlations}
%\label
% method, plots, [diff between series/residuals], talk

\subsection{Rolling correlation}
%\label
% method, plots, talk

\section{Modeling multivariate dependence: Copula} % (fold)
%\label


\subsection{Multivariate model selection}
%\label
% why copula?
% explain logic and intuition: this is a parsimonious way, and solves the two issues with asymmetry and time-variation to some extent
% other models BEKK, etc have issues with dimensionality or can't capture the features of threshold and rolling

\subsection{Copula}
%\label
% method of model
% estimation of model

\subsection{Copula results with constant correlations}
%\label
% diagnostics of fit
% include threshold correlations, look better for skewed t, gaussian bad

\subsection{Copula results with dynamic correlations}
%\label
% still haven't captured dynamic, lets do this now
% diagnostics of fit
% why we prefer symmetric t
% correlation patterns over time in-sample graph looks very much like the data rolling

% potentially subsection exogenous regressors
%

\section{Putting the model to work}
%\label
% now, lets see what this model can say about a few things

\subsection{Mean-variance investing}
%\label
% fama french regressions, what actually happens to MV weights, do they go to zero?
% explain method for out-of-sample distributions, simulation based
% show that weights don't go to zero, not for sample and not for advanced super copula model
% what is the out-of-sample investment performance of relying on the best copula model?
% it looks pretty good but not drastically better than relying on sample average - OOS is hard

\subsection{Conditional diversification benefits}
%\label
% what are the theoretical diversificaiton benefits of including hml? is HML or CMA riskier if one can only choose either or? CDB analysis
