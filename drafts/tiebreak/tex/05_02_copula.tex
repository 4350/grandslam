\subsection{Definition of copula model} % (fold)
\label{sub:definition_of_copula_model}

Each week $t$, the conditional joint density of returns $R_{t+1} = \{r_{i,t+1},\ldots,r_{N,t+1}\}$ is described by a joint density function $f_t(R_{t+1})$. Following~\textcite{ChristoffersenErrunzaJacobLanglois2012}, who build on~\textcite{Patton2006} and~\textcite{Sklar1959}, we decompose the joint density function into the product of a joint copula function $c_t(U_{t+1})$ of uniformly distributed variables $U_{t+1} \sim U(0, 1)$ and marginal densities $f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1})$:
\begin{align}
  f_t(R_{t+1}) =
    c_t(U_{t+1}) \prod^N_{i=1} f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1})
  \label{eq:copula_sklar}
\end{align}
The elements of $U_{t+1} = \{u_{i,t+1},\ldots,u_{N,t+1}\}$ are related to the original returns by the probability integral transform, i.e the cumulative distribution of $r_{i,t+1}$:
\begin{align}
  u_{i,t+1} = F_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1}) = \int_{-\infty}^{r_{i,t+1}} f_{i,t}(r)dr
\end{align}
The copula function $c_t(U_{t+1})$ is a multivariate skewed Student's \emph{t} distribution. This distribution is parametrised by a single degrees of freedom parameter $\nu_c$, controlling the degree of dependency, a vector of $N$ skewness parameters $\gamma_c$, controlling the asymmetry in dependency, and a potentially time-varying correlation matrix $\Psi_{t}$. We describe the details of the skewed Student's t distribution, including the expanded form of $c_t$, in~\autoref{app:ghstmv}. The skewed Student's \emph{t} distribution nests the Student's \emph{t} distribution when all $\gamma_{i,c} = 0$ and the standard normal distribution when additionally $\nu_c = \infty$.

The log-likelihood of the model is constructed from~\autoref{eq:copula_sklar}:
\begin{align}
  L =
    \underbrace{\sum_{t=1}^T \log(c_t(U_{t+1}))}_\text{Copula} +
    \underbrace{\sum_{t=1}^T \sum_{i=1}^N \log(f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1}))}_\text{Marginals}
\end{align}
At this point, it is worth noting that the joint density $c_t(U_{t+1})$ need not be of the same family as the marginal densities $f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1})$ -- nor are we restricted to modeling $f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1})$ jointly for all factors. In fact, we take advantage of this flexibility and choose to model the marginal densities independently as ARMA-GARCH processes, which allows us to capture a number of predictable features in the univariate series -- serial correlation, volatility clustering and leverage effects. The marginal models are estimated independently by maximizing the likelihood(s) of the second term, and then the copula is estimated by maximizing the first -- using the residuals of the marginal models.

This procedure is called multi-stage maximum log-likelihood or inference functions for margins and greatly simplifies the estimation procedure while yielding relatively efficient estimates~\autocite{Patton2006,Joe1997}. The modeling and estimation of our ARMA-GARCH models is detailed in the upcoming subsection, whereas the remainder of this subsection describes how we make $\Psi_t$ and thus the dependence between factors dynamic.

The copula is made dynamic by fitting a dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) process for $\Psi_t$ to copula residuals $z_{t+1}^*$~\autocite{Engle2002}. Using the notation from~\textcite{ChristoffersenLanglois2013}:
\begin{align}
  Q_t = (1 - \alpha - \beta) Q
    + \beta Q_{t-1}
    + \alpha \bar{z}_{t-1}^* \bar{z}_{t-1}^{*\top}
  \label{eq:copula_cdcc}
\end{align}
where $Q_t$ is normalized to the correlation matrix $\Psi_t$:
\begin{align}
  \Psi_t = Q_t^{-\frac{1}{2}} Q_t Q_t^{-\frac{1}{2}}
  \label{eq:copula_cdcc_psi}
\end{align}
The $Q_t$ process is comprised of three components that are weighted according to $\alpha, \beta$: (1) a time-invariant component, $Q$ (2) an innovation component from copula shocks, $\bar{z}_{t-1}^{*} \bar{z}_{t-1}^{*\top},$\footnote{Where $\bar{z}_{i,t+1}^* = z_{i,t+1}^* \sqrt{q_{ii,t}}$ is due to a correction by~\textcite{Aielli2013}, that improves the reliability of the estimation procedure.} and (3) an autoregressive component of order one $Q_{t-1}$. In order for the the correlation matrix $\Psi_t$ to be positive definite, $Q_t$ has to be positive definite, which is ascertained by requiring that $\alpha \geq 0$, $\beta \geq 0$ and $(\alpha + \beta) < 1$. The model nests a constant copula when $\alpha = \beta = 0$.

The model for $c_t(U_{t+1})$ is thus comprised of $1 + N$ distribution parameters $\{\nu_c, \gamma_c\}$ and ($2 + (N(N-1) / 2)$) dynamics parameters $\{\alpha, \beta, Q\}$ where the elements of $Q$ are estimated using moment matching, and the remaining $3 + N$ parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood.\footnote{We have relegated the details of the estimation of the dynamic process to~\autoref{app:copula_cdcc}.}

% Gustaf: Här är det svårt -- jag har svårt att beskriva $z_t^*$ när konceptet
% standardized returns är en del av ARMA-GARCH delen. Vet ej riktigt hur man
% ska komma åt det. Ett sätt är att ta tjuren vid hornen och beskriva att 
% f_{i,t}(r_{i,t+1}) = f_i(z_{i,t+1}) = 
% f_i(\varepsilon_{i,t+1}/\sigma_{i,t+1}). men ja.
ARMA-GARCH modeling allows us to filter time-varying effects, leaving independent \emph{standardized returns} (or standardized residuals) $z_{i,t}$ assumed to follow a constant distribution $f_i(z_{i,t})$. These residuals are first transformed into uniform variables $u_{i,t+1}$ by the probability integral transform of the densities above, and then made to follow the \emph{copula} distribution by the \emph{inverse} probability integral transform of the \emph{copula}:
\begin{align}
  z_{i,t+1}^* = F^{-1}_{\nu_c,\gamma_{i,c}}(F_{i}(z_{i,t+1}))
\end{align}
