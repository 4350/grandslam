\section{Abnormal return regressions}
\label{sec:alpha_reg}
\textcite{FF2015} and \textcite{Asness2015} run factor regressions where both the LHS variable and the RHS variables are zero-cost factor portfolios. The intercept in these regressions is to be interpreted as the abnormal return, or Jensen's alpha, of adding the LHS factor to a portfolio already consisting of the RHS factors \autocite{Jensen1968}. In this section, we estimate regressions similar to these two papers on a weekly data set, to see whether the results of previous research hold up in the weekly data set.

As a specific example, we begin by considering the regression that has caused the discussion on whether HML is a redundant variable. \textcite{FF2015} run the regression
\begin{align}
  r^{HML}_t = \alpha + \beta_1 r^{Mkt.RF}_t + \beta_2 r^{SMB}_t + \beta_3 r^{RMW}_t + \beta_4 r^{CMA}_t + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
where $r^i_t$ denote monthly returns. The central finding is that HML is completely subsumed by the four factors Mkt.RF, SMB, RMW and CMA -- the alpha of the regression is very small and not statistically significant. In other words, adding HML to a portfolio of the other four factors should give no alpha.

Our regression analysis deviates from that in \textcite{FF2015} as we consider weekly return data and a slightly extended data window. However, the main regression specifications are the same. We also consider a six-factor model, as done by \textcite{Asness2015}, who show that there is in fact added value of HML when momentum is included in the regression. In \autoref{fig:abnormal}, regressions for the five-factor and six-factor models are presented. Each column represents one unique regression, with one of the factors as the LHS variable and with the remaining four (or five) factors as RHS variables (in rows). The reported standard errors are adjusted for autocorrelation, as such effects are found in the return data (see \autoref{sec:data}).

First, we examine regression (1) in a five-factor model where HML is the LHS variable. We note that the alpha of HML is not significant, indicating that the factor is completely subsumed by the remaining four factors and does not create additional value in a portfolio setting. More specifically, the only factor that explains HML is CMA, with a high coefficient of 0.85, with all other factor loadings insignificant and close to zero. Note, however, that the high loading on CMA does not imply any ordering or causality as the parameter estimate is based on contemporary covariance alone. The R-squared of 45\% indicates that the HML factor has substantial variance that is unexplained by the regression, indicating that the factor comprises unique information beyond that in CMA.

Second, we turn to regression (2) in a five factor model where CMA is the LHS variable. Here, the alpha is significant, indicating that the factor does provide additional value beyond the existing four factors. While the CMA factor loads positively 0.39 on HML, this is substantially lower than HML's loading on CMA of 0.85. Put differently, CMA seems to be explained by other factors than HML to a higher extent than vice versa. With CMA as the LHS variable, there is significant negative loading on RMW and a significant positive loading on Mom. The CMA portfolio loads relatively more on unprofitable stocks (negative RMW) and loads relatively more on stocks with high recent returns (positive Mom).

Now, we move to the six-factor regression results, where we include the momentum factor Mom. First, in regression (3) with HML as the LHS variable, we note that the addition of HML has made the alpha of HML positive and significant. As momentum is correlated with both the LHS and RHS factors, it constituted an omitted variable bias on the beta factor loadings in the five-factor model. HML has a substantial negative loading on the Mom factor of -0.18, while the CMA regression instead has a positive Mom loading of 0.09, indicating that the seemingly similar factors are quite different in terms of momentum properties. The HML factor is more loaded on stocks that have had low recent returns, while the CMA factor is more loaded on stocks that have had high recent returns. The momentum factor has improved the r-squared when HML is the LHS variable, explaining an additional 8\% of the variance in the factor.

In summary, our results are qualitatively similar to the results in \textcite{FF2015} as well as \textcite{Asness2015}, although we employ weekly data. The alpha of HML is only recognized in a model including momentum. This finding indicates that the insignificant alpha of HML in the five-factor model might be due to the omission of an important control variable, momentum, that is included in the six-factor-model. Furthermore, the regressions highlight that HML is relatively comprised of more stocks with recent low returns than CMA, and that CMA is relatively comprised of more stocks with low profitability.
