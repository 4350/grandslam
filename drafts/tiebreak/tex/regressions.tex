\section{Zero-cost portfolio regressions}
\label{sec:alpha_reg}
\textcite{FF2015} and \textcite{Asness2015} run factor regressions where both the LHS variable and the RHS variables are zero-cost factor portfolios. The intercept in these regressions is to be interpreted as the abnormal return, or Jensen's alpha, of adding the LHS factor to a portfolio already consisting of the RHS factors \autocite{Jensen1968}. In this section, we replicate and discuss the regressions where HML, CMA and RMW are the LHS variables, and find that previous results hold up in our weekly data set.

\subsection{Regression Models}

As a specific example, we begin by considering the regression that has caused the discussion on whether HML is a redundant variable. \textcite{FF2015} run the regression
\begin{align}
  r^{HML}_t = \alpha + \beta_1 r^{Mkt.RF}_t + \beta_2 r^{SMB}_t + \beta_3 r^{RMW}_t + \beta_4 r^{CMA}_t + \epsilon_t
\end{align}
where $r^i_t$ denote monthly returns. The central finding is that HML is completely subsumed by the four factors Mkt.RF, SMB, RMW and CMA -- the alpha of the regression is very small and not statistically significant. In other words, adding HML to a portfolio of the other four factors should give no alpha.

Our regression analysis deviates from that in \textcite{FF2015} as we consider weekly return data and a slightly extended data window. However, the main regression specifications are the same. We also consider a six-factor model, as done by \textcite{Asness2015}, who show that there is in fact added value of HML when momentum is included in the regression. We use standard errors that are adjusted for serial correlation found in the return data.

\subsection{Regression Results}

In \autoref{fig:abnormal}, regressions for the five-factor and six-factor models are presented. Each column represents one unique regression, with one of the factors as the LHS variable and with the remaining four (or five) factors as RHS variables (in rows).

First, we examine regression (1) in a five-factor model where HML is the LHS variable. We note that the alpha of HML is not significant, indicating that the factor is completely subsumed by the remaining four factors and does not create additional value in a portfolio setting, in line with~\textcite{FF2015}. More specifically, the only factor that explains HML is CMA, with a high coefficient of 0.85, with all other factor loadings insignificant and close to zero. Put differently, this suggests that for a factor portfolio already loaded on Market, CMA, SMB and RMW adding HML will load up additionally on CMA risk plus the idiosyncratic risks of HML without any additional return.

Second, we turn to regression (2) in a five factor model where CMA is the LHS variable. Here, the alpha is significant, indicating that the factor does provide an additional 0.06\% weekly beyond the existing four factors. While the CMA factor loads positively 0.39 on HML, this is substantially lower than HML's loading on CMA of 0.85. Put differently, CMA seems to be load on other factors than HML to a higher extent than vice versa. With CMA as the LHS variable, there is a significant negative loading on Mkt-RF, a significant negative loading on RMW and a significant positive loading on Mom. The CMA portfolio loads relatively less on the market, relatively more on unprofitable stocks (negative RMW) and loads relatively more on stocks with high recent returns (positive Mom) than does HML.

Third, we study regression (3) where RMW is the LHS variable. The alpha is significant, indicating that the RMW factor adds abnormal return of 0.09\% weekly to the four existing factors. In terms of factor loadings, profitability loads zero or negatively on all four remaining factors in the five-factor model. Especially noteworthy are the large negative loadings on SMB and CMA of -0.24 and -0.15, which suggests that SMB is comprised relatively more of large firms and investing firms. The fact that there are only negative loadings is in itself evidence of the great diversification that RMW provides -- it even covaries negatively with all five factors. The low explanatory power of the other factors is summarized by a low 15\% r-squared.

\input{tex/tables/regression_table}

Now, we move to the six-factor regression results, where we include the momentum factor Mom. First, in regression (4) with HML as the LHS variable, we note that the addition of HML has made the alpha of HML positive and significant -- in line with~\textcite{Asness2015}. As momentum is correlated with both the LHS and RHS factors, it constituted an omitted variable bias on the beta factor loadings in the five-factor model. HML has a substantial negative loading on the Mom factor of -0.18, while the CMA regression instead has a positive Mom loading of 0.09, suggesting that the seemingly similar factors are quite different in terms of momentum properties. HML firms are generally comprised of recent losers, while CMA firms are recent winners. The momentum factor has explained an additional 8\% of the variance in the HML factor.

As in the five-factor model, we also note differences in some of the other factor loadings between HML and CMA in the six-factor model. The CMA regression (reg. 5) loads relatively less on the market and relatively more on unprofitable stocks. It therefore seems that while HML and CMA firms share certain properties, HML firms are generally more profitable and less comparable to holding the market itself. The profitability factor (reg. 6) is largely unaffected by the addition of momentum the six-factor specification, which is expected given the low correlation (0.08) between the RMW and Mom factors. 

Although we employ weekly data, our results are qualitatively similar to the results in \textcite{FF2015} as well as in \textcite{Asness2015}. The alpha of HML is only recognized in a model including momentum. This finding indicates that the insignificant alpha of HML in the five-factor model might be due to the omission of an important control variable, momentum, that is included in the six-factor-model. This does suggest that HML is not dead, when including momentum.
