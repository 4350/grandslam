\section{Modeling of Factor Returns} % (fold)
\label{sec:modeling_of_factor_returns}

% Why a model?
This section presents our model for the joint behavior of returns. A multivariate model of returns allows us to make conditional forecasts of the distribution of returns one week ahead, which take into account the dependence between factors. The model is used in the mean-variance analysis, to provide dynamic inputs that can give us optimal weights over time. The model is also used in the analysis of diversification benefits, when we shift the focus to the tail risk of factor portfolios. First, we describe why we choose the copula model among different multivariate models. Second, we describe the building blocks of the model and analyze which specification best suits the dependence structure in the data. Last, we provide estimates and describe the model we retain for further use.

\input{tex/05_01_choosing} % motivating the choice of copula, and among copulas

\input{tex/05_02_copula} % the boom

\input{tex/05_03_univariate} % arma garch

\input{tex/05_04_dependence} % threshold and rolling

\input{tex/05_05_copula_results} % estimation results and explaining parameterization choice

\input{tex/05_06_copula_robustness} % constant threshold corrs simulated, maybe also add robustness check of whether the model captures roll-corrs 

%\subsection{Model retained for further use}
%Here we could describe again the model we use in MV and CDB. E.g. dynamic std. If the reader doesn't follow anything of the first four subsections, she should at least be able to pick up what we use here.
