\section{Introduction}
\textcite{FF2015} find that the value factor, HML, is redundant in a four-factor model including profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA), as it has no explanatory power on monthly returns in a US 1963–2010 sample. This could mean that the classic value factor is an inferior proxy for what truly comprises value. This paper takes a risk perspective on factor equity strategies and investigates what role HML has in factor investing, given the discovery of RMW and CMA. 

How can it be that HML is subsumed by CMA and RMW? While most factor pairs exhibit relatively low correlation, the CMA and HML pair stands out with an unconditional correlation in our sample period of approx. 0.60, indicating a much higher similarity between these two factors. In fact, there is reason to expect a certain degree of overlap between the portfolios that comprise HML and CMA; it is now considered a fact that value firms invest less, and growth firms invest more, and that there is a positive empirical relation between past investment and current book-to-market ratios~\autoref{Zhang05, Anderson-GarciaFeijóo06}. We therefore place additional emphasis on the role of HML as an alternative to CMA.

While analyses could be made on sample data alone, we wish to thoroughly examine factors by building a conditional model of return series, that can incorporate dependencies that are otherwise hard to capture in sample data, such as time-varying correlations and tail dependence. Tail dependence is the notion that there might be significantly different dependence patterns when returns simultaneously realize in the lower or upper tail, as opposed to close to the center of the distribution. From previous research on factors~\autocite{ChristoffersenLanglois2013}, we have reason to believe that the factor strategies exhibit both tail dependence and dynamic correlations, and show that this is the case also for RMW and CMA.

Recently, copula models have attracted considerable attention in the risk management field, as they offer a numerically feasible and flexible way of estimating joint probability distributions. From a copula model, we are able to simulate one-week ahead conditional forecasts of the return series. More specifically, a copula model can be estimated with univariate models as a starting point. First, we examine the factor return series on a univariate level and find evidence of autocorrelation and volatility clustering, in line with stylized facts on financial return series, and specify univariate models from the ARMA-GARCH family to capture these dynamics. The ARMA-GARCH models achieve white noise residuals for each factor, but we show that there is still substantial dependence between the residual series, indicating multivariate dependence. The copula then uses the residual series from these models and tries to explain the interdependence. The main advantage of using a copula is that it is flexible enough to generate tail dependence as well as dynamic correlations, and might improve on the description of return series.

Our contribution is...

We revisit the regressions of \textcite{FF2015} that show a zero alpha of including HML in a four-factor portfolio of Mkt-RF, SMB, RMW and CMA, but replace monthly data with weekly data and include the momentum factor. Weekly data gives a more granular understanding of risk, as shocks are more smoothed on a monthly basis. Momentum is also included, as it is frequently used in factor equity investing.\footnote{See i.a. \textcite{Pedersen2015}, \textcite{Ilmanen2011}} 

We then test the conjecture in \textcite{FF2015} that the insignificant alpha of adding HML to a four-factor portfolio implies that a mean-variance investor should in fact not include HML in her portfolio. By saving a third of the data for out-of-sample analysis, we re-estimate the copula model and construct mean-variance optimal portfolios and study the optimal weights over time. In the mean-variance analysis, we can also quantify the Sharpe ratios of portfolios including and excluding HML and CMA respectively. In addition to Sharpe ratios, we quantify higher moment risk measures of competing portfolios, including skewness and maximum drawdown. Furthermore, the out-of-sample investing investigates the performance of different copula specifications. Do conditional and asymmetric models improve the Sharpe ratio? And what happens to other risk measures?

Finally, we study the diversification benefits of HML, RMW and CMA respectively, based on simulations from a model of joint returns. More specifically, we take the copula model of factor returns as given and investigate how close the expected shortfall of a factor portfolio can come to the theoretical optimum, which is the same portfolio's Value-at-Risk. This statistic, the conditional diversification benefit (CDB) is due to \textcite{ChristoffersenErrunzaJacobLanglois2012}, and can, in the model setting, shed light on the relative benefits of including one of the similar factors HML or CMA, respectively.

The structure of this thesis is as follows: in \autoref{sec:2} we provide a brief literature review of factor strategies and the work on copulas relating to factors. In \autoref{sec:3} we present the data used and detail the construction of factors. In \autoref{sec:4} we present the main empirical analysis by interleaving method and results. In \autoref{sec:5} we summarize our findings and discuss their wider implications.
