\section{Mean-Variance optimization} % (fold)
\label{sec:mean_variance}

\subsection{Optimal weights according to copula and sample inputs}

In \autoref{fig:mv_optimal_5}, we present the optimized weights over time in the five-factor universe. The left hand column presents weights of factors when we consider the inclusion and exclusion of HML, while the right hand column presents weights of factors when CMA is included and excluded. The static lines represent the weights based on sample estimators of the mean-variance inputs, while the dynamic weights are based on one-week-ahead forecasts from the copula model. All weights have been smoothed as 1-year moving averages in order to make them easier to read.

Accompanying the graph, \autoref{tab:mv_model} presents average MV optimal weights based on copula inputs of expected returns and covariances. This table also gives average weight differences between models and a number of performance measures that are based on the realized returns. The CDB statistic is based on optimal weights and uses the copula model as the distribution of returns. Please note that all performance measures are calculated in-sample and are not indicative of out-of-sample investing based on a copula model; they should be interpreted only in relative terms, in order to determine how much the SR is impacted by the exclusion of a factor.\footnote{A similar table of performance measures and average weight differences for sample inputs of expected returns and covariances is found in \autoref{app:mv_sample}.}

We begin by examining the left column of plots in \autoref{fig:mv_optimal_5} that includes and excludes HML. First, we note that the weight of HML is clearly not zero when introduced in the investible universe. This appears to be the case for both the sample estimate of means and covariances, as well as the dynamic estimates from the copula model. Both inputs suggest that HML does in fact improve the tangency portfolio, as the optimal portfolio has a positive weight on the factor. The inclusion leads to an increase in realized SR, which goes from [x] to [y] using dynamic weights.

Although we impose the additional restriction of no negative weights, this finding does stand in contrast to the conjecture in \textcite{FF2015} that HML should not improve the tangency portfolio. While the unconstrained tangency portfolio may or may not include HML, the simple restriction of no negative weights makes HML an important part of the optimal portfolio. However, we notice that the sample inputs result in a lower allocation to HML (approx. 6\%) than the dynamic inputs from the copula (approx. 18\%).

Second, we note that the dynamic weight of HML seems to be highly similar to the decrease in weight in CMA, while all the remaining factors seem to stay very close to their original weights when moving to the six-factor model. In other words, the weight that is attributed to HML is drawn nearly directly from the weight of CMA, in each period. Our interpretation is that in a five-factor excluding HML, CMA proxies for HML, which is why CMA absorbs nearly all the weight. HML also seems to proxy for CMA to a lesser extent, as shown by the right hand column of plots, which include and exclude CMA. When CMA is included, the weight of HML is significantly lowered, but so are the weights of SMB and RMW. The proxying behavior of HML and CMA is expected, as the factors are highly correlated and zero-cost portfolio regressions in this thesis (\autoref{fig:abnormal}), as well as in \textcite{FF2015} and \textcite{Asness2015}, indicate that the main explanatory variable for HML is CMA, and vice versa.

Third, we find that among the two newly introduced factors CMA and RMW, the latter seems to have a more substantial impact on the mean-variance portfolio. RMW receives weights of approx. 35\% in the five-factor models, and approx. 30\% in the six-factor model, which is nearly twice the allocation of any other factor. Furthermore, the exclusion of RMW leads to a decrease in the realized SR from [x] to [y], while the exclusion of CMA only decreases the SR to  . This highlights the potential of the RMW strategy, which is expected due to its low or negative factor loadings in the zero-cost portfolio regressions (see \autoref{sec:alpha_reg}).

The above results are similar when we repeat the mean-variance optimizations in the six-factor-model universe excluding HML and CMA. Using both sample inputs and copula inputs of the expected returns and covariances, we find no reason to believe that mean-variance investing in the HML factor is dead or fully subsumed by the remaining factors, as the optimal portfolio includes HML and has a higher realized SR. We also note that the inclusion of RMW leads to a large weight allocation to the factor and a substantial increase in realized SR.
